## Escrow Protocol

A one-time use escrow smart contract that works as follows:

1. Seller deploys the contract and set the price
1. Seller initiates the contract by staking the price
1. Buyer initiates the contract by staking the price
1. Buyer transfers the sale price to the contract
1. Buyer confirms delivery of an item and the contract handles the transfers
    - Buyer gets the stake back
    - Seller gets the stake back and the purchase price


## Requirements
- Node.JS v8 with npm

## Steps
1. `npm install`
1. For convenience, install Truffle globally: npm install -g truffle@0.0.0, replacing 0.0.0 by the Truffle version from package.json
1. Install Ganache (Formerly, testrpc), either:
   * UI version of version 1.1.0 or
   * Console version: `npm install -g ganache-cli@6.1.0` and then (from another terminal tab): `ganache-cli`
1. `truffle compile`
